# Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python

# Project 1
Overview
This project explored a provided database of movie rentals in which the student had to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the student's queries.

For the presentation component, the student had to create four slides, and each should have (a) a question of interest, (b) a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question, (c) a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest.

# Project 2
Overview
In this project, the student explored data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal was to use Python to analyze and compute descriptive statistics, answering questions about the data. Additionally, the student created a command-line interface (CLI) program that allows users to interactively explore the data and view relevant statistics.

The program enables users to:

Import and filter the data by city, month, and weekday.
Compute descriptive statistics, such as the most common times of travel, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics.
Display raw data in the terminal, with options to sort the data by columns in ascending or descending order.

Project Submission

The CLI program provides an engaging interactive experience for users to explore the bikeshare data. Users can dynamically filter the data and view relevant statistics or raw data. The program ensures flexibility by supporting multiple input options and sorting functionality for raw data display.

## Files Used
The following data files are required to run the program:

washington.csv<br>
new_york_city.csv<br>
chicago.csv<br>

## Requirements
This program is written in Python (version 3.6.3 or later) and depends on the following libraries:

pandas==0.23.3 <br>
numpy==1.12.1 <br>
os (standard Python library)<br>
